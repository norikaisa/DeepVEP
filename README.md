# DeepVEP

Deep learning algorithm to classify mfVEP

Multifocal visual evoked potential (mfVEP) is used for assessing visual functions in
patients with pituitary adenomas. Images generated by mfVEP facilitate evaluation of
visual pathway integrity. However, lack of healthy controls, and high time consumption
for analyzing data restrict the use of mfVEP in clinical settings; moreover, low
signal-noise-ratio (SNR) in some images further increases the difficulty of analysis. I
hypothesized that automated workflow with deep learning could facilitate analysis and
correct classification of these images. A total of 9,120 images were used in this study.
The automated workflow included clustering ideal and noisy images, denoising images
using an autoencoder algorithm, and classifying normal and abnormal images using a
convolutional neural network. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of the
initial algorithm (built on all the images) was 0.801 with an accuracy of 79.9%. The model
built on denoised images had an AUC of 0.795 (95%CI: 0.773–0.817) and an accuracy of
78.6%(95%CI: 76.8–80.0%). Themodel built on ideal images had an AUC of 0.985 (95%
CI: 0.976–0.994) and an accuracy of 94.6%(95%CI: 93.6–95.6%). The ensemble model
achieved an AUC of 0.908 and an accuracy of 90.8% (sensitivity: 94.3%; specificity:
87.7%). The automated workflow for analyzing mfVEP plots achieved high AUC and
accuracy, which suggests its possible clinical use.
